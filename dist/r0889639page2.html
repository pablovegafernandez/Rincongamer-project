                        action games, but with how popular they are, they are basically their own genre now. As the name implies, in these
                        games the player will control a character and use a weapon usually a guns or projectile based weapons which can be
                        used in combination with other tools such as grenades for indirect offense, armor for additional defense, or
                        accessories such as telescopic sights to modify the behavior of the weapons. A common resource found in many shooter
                        games is ammunition, armor or health, or upgrades which augment the player character's weapons.</p> <a

                    <div class="collapse collapse-jumbotron px-3" id="action"><p class="pt-3">In an action game, the player typically
                        controls a character often in the form of a protagonist or avatar. This player character must navigate a level,
                        collecting objects, avoiding obstacles, and battling enemies with their natural skills as well as weapons and other
                        tools at their disposal. At the end of a level or group of levels, the player must often defeat a boss enemy that is
                        more challenging and often a major antagonist in the game's story. Enemy attacks and obstacles deplete the player
                        character's health and lives, and the player receives a game over when they run out of lives.</p>
                        <p>Alternatively, the player gets to the end of the game by finishing a sequence of levels to complete a final goal,
                            and see the credits. But some action games, such as early arcade games, are unbeatable and have an indefinite
                            number of levels; with the player's only goal being to get as far as they can to maximize their score.</p> <a

                        height that requires use of the player character's abilities in order to traverse. Other acrobatic maneuvers factor

                        terminology, settings and game mechanics as early tabletop role-playing games such as Dungeons &amp; Dragons.
                        Players control a central game character, or multiple game characters, usually called a party, and attain victory by
                        completing a series of quests or reaching the conclusion of a central storyline. Players explore a game world, while
                        solving puzzles and engaging in combat. A key feature of the genre is that characters grow in power and abilities,
                        and characters are typically designed by the player. RPGs rarely challenge a player's physical coordination or
                        reaction time, with the exception of action role-playing games.</p>
                        <p> Role-playing video games typically rely on a highly developed story and setting,[4] which is divided into a
                            number of quests. Players control one or several characters by issuing commands, which are performed by the
                            character at an effectiveness determined by that character's numeric attributes. Often these attributes increase
                            each time a character gains a level, and a character's level goes up each time the player accumulates a certain
                            amount of experience. </p> <a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" href="r0889639page1.html#roleplayinggames"

                    <div class="collapse collapse-jumbotron px-3" id="strategy"><p class="pt-3"> Strategy video games are a genre of video
                        game that emphasize skillful thinking and planning to achieve victory. Specifically, a player must plan a series of
                        actions against one or more opponents, and the reduction of enemy forces is usually a goal. Victory is achieved
                        through superior planning, and the element of chance takes a smaller role. In most strategy video games, the player
                        is given a godlike view of the game world, and indirectly controls game units under their command. Thus, most
                        strategy games involve elements of warfare to varying degrees, and feature a combination of tactical and strategic
                        considerations. In addition to combat, these games often challenge the player's ability to explore, or manage an

                        field, extreme sports and combat sports. Some games emphasize actually playing the sport (such as FIFA, Pro
                        Evolution Soccer and Madden NFL), whilst others emphasize strategy and sport management (such as Football Manager
                        and Out of the Park Baseball). Some, such as Need for Speed, Arch Rivals and Punch-Out!!, satirize the sport for
                        comic effect. This genre has been popular throughout the history of video games and is competitive, just like
                        real-world sports. A number of game series feature the names and characteristics of real teams and players, and are

                        survive and complete a goal. Survival games focus on the survival parts of these games, while encouraging
                        exploration of an open world. They are primarily action games, though some gameplay elements present in the
                        action-adventure genre—such as resource management and item crafting—are commonly found in survival games, and are
                        central elements in titles like Survival Kids. At the start of a typical survival game, the player is placed alone
                        in the game's world with few resources. It is not uncommon for players to spend the majority or entirety of the game
                        without encountering a friendly non-player character; since NPCs are typically hostile to the player, the emphasis
                        is placed on avoidance, rather than confrontation. In some games, however, combat is unavoidable and provides the
                        player with valuable resources (e.g., food, weapons, and armor).</p> <a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg"

                        has employed espionage, counter-terrorism, and rogue themes, with protagonists who are special forces operatives,
                        special agents, spies, thieves, ninjas, or assassins. Some games have also combined stealth elements with other
                        genres, such as first-person shooters and platformers.</p> <a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg"

                    <div class="collapse collapse-jumbotron px-3" id="indie"><p class="pt-3">An independent video game or indie game is a
                        video game typically created by individuals or smaller development teams without the financial and technical support
                        of a large game publisher, in contrast to most "AAA" (triple-A) games. However, the "indie" term may apply to other
                        scenarios where the development of the game has some measure of independence from a publisher even if a publisher
                        helps fund and distribute a game, such as creative freedom. Because of their independence and freedom to develop,
                        indie games often focus on innovation, experimental gameplay, and taking risks not usually afforded in AAA games,
                        and may explore the medium to produce unique experiences in art games. Indie games tend to be sold through digital
                        distribution channels rather than at retail due to lack of publisher support. The term is synonymous with that of
                        independent music or independent film in those respective mediums.</p> <a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg"
