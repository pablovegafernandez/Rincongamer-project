                                    <p> Dark Souls is a third-person action role-playing game. A core mechanic of the game is exploration.
                                        Players are encouraged by the game to proceed with caution, learn from past mistakes, or find
                                        alternative areas to explore. Dark Souls takes place in a large and continuous open world
                                        environment, connected through a central hub area. The player character can travel between areas and
                                        explore various paths at will, although prerequisites have to be met to unlock certain areas.</p>

                                    <p>Limbo is a puzzle-platform video game developed by independent studio Playdead. The game was released
                                        in July 2010 on Xbox Live Arcade, and has since been ported to several other systems, including the
                                        PlayStation 3, Linux and Microsoft Windows. Limbo is a 2D side-scroller, incorporating a physics
                                        system that governs environmental objects and the player character. The player guides an unnamed boy
                                        through dangerous environments and traps as he searches for his sister. The developer built the
                                        game's puzzles expecting the player to fail before finding the correct solution. Playdead called the
                                        style of play "trial and death", and used gruesome imagery for the boy's deaths to steer the player

                                        defeat Alduin the World-Eater, a dragon who is prophesied to destroy the world. The game is set 200
                                        years after the events of Oblivion and takes place in Skyrim, the northernmost province of Tamriel.
                                        Over the course of the game, the player completes quests and develops the character by improving
                                        skills. The game continues the open-world tradition of its predecessors by allowing the player to
                                        travel anywhere in the game world at any time, and to ignore or postpone the main storyline
                                        indefinitely.</p></div>

                                        machines dominate the land. Human civilization has regressed to tribal societies of hunters and

                                    <p> A spin-off of the Fallout series, the game is set in a post-apocalyptic open world environment that
                                        encompasses a region consisting of Arizona, California, and Nevada. It is set in a world that
                                        deviated onto an alternate timeline thanks to Atomic Age technology, which eventually led to a
                                        global nuclear apocalypse in the year 2077 in an event referred to as "The Great War", caused by a
                                        major conflict between the U.S. and China over natural resources. The main story of New Vegas takes
                                        place in the year 2281, four years after the events of Fallout 3 and 204 years after the bombs fell.
                                        It is not a direct sequel, but does mark the return of several elements found in Fallout 2.</p>

                                        character and simple objects using "the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device", a device that can
                                        create inter-spatial portals between two flat planes. The player-character, Chell, is challenged and

                                        to each of the two teams, using rocket-powered vehicles to hit a ball into their opponent's goal and
                                        score points over the course of a match. The game includes single-player and multiplayer modes that
                                        can be played both locally and online, including cross-platform play between all versions. Later
                                        updates for the game enabled the ability to modify core rules and added new game modes, including

                                        in the late 22nd century. There is one sole longterm survivor, who is the protagonist of the story.

                                    <p>Minecraft is a 3D sandbox game that has no specific goals to accomplish, allowing players a large
                                        amount of freedom in choosing how to play the game. However, there is an achievement system, known
                                        as "advancements" in the Java Edition of the game, and "trophies" on the PlayStation ports. Gameplay
                                        is in the first-person perspective by default, but players have the option for third-person
                                        perspective . The game world is composed of rough 3D objectsâ€”mainly cubes and fluids, and commonly
                                        called "blocks"â€”representing various materials, such as dirt, stone, ores, tree trunks, water, and
                                        lava. The core gameplay revolves around picking up and placing these objects. These blocks are
                                        arranged in a 3D grid, while players can move freely around the world. Players can "mine" blocks and
                                        then place them elsewhere, enabling them to build things.</p></div>

                                    <p>Forza Horizon focuses specifically on casual street racing, rather than professionally on race tracks
                                        , as it takes place on a map of temporarily closed public roads. It features multiple types of races
                                        , from drift to rally and point-to-point races. The roads feature both AI traffic and when playing
                                        online, other festival drivers. Players may challenge the other racers they encounter in a
                                        one-on-one race to a given location. The races start at the current location, and finish at a
                                        randomly generated way-point, usually more than 500 metres away from the player and their opponent.
                                        A skill system is implemented in the game; players earn popularity during races by driving
                                        aggressively. Acts such as drifting, jumping over obstacles and getting a car on two wheels all
                                        contribute to the player's popularity level. These can be chained together in a combo, which in turn
                                        affects the money players are paid at the end of a given race. Cred also affects a player's
                                        popularity level in the game. As a player's popularity level increases new special events are
                                        unlocked, such as races against helicopters and planes.</p></div>

                                    <p>Dirt Rally is a racing video game focused on rallying. Players compete in timed stage events on
                                        tarmac and off-road terrain in varying weather conditions. On release, the game featured 17 cars, 36
                                        stages from three real world locations - Monte Carlo, Powys and Argolis - and asynchronous
                                        multiplayer. Stages range from 4 to 16 km. Subsequent updates added three more locations in the form
                                        of Baumholder, JÃ¤msÃ¤ and VÃ¤rmland, as well as rallycross and player versus player multiplayer modes.
                                        Codemasters announced a partnership with the FIA World Rallycross Championship in July 2015, leading
                                        to the inclusion of the Lydden Hill Race Circuit (England), LÃ¥nkebanen (Norway), and HÃ¶ljesbanan
