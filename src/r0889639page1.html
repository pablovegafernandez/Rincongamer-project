                                    <p>Call of Duty is a first-person shooter video game franchise published by Activision. Starting out in
                                        2003, it first focused on games set in World War II. Over time, the series has seen games set in the
                                        midst of the Cold War, futuristic worlds, and outer space. The games were first developed by
                                        Infinity
                                        Ward, then also by Treyarch and Sledgehammer Games. Several spin-off and handheld games were made by
                                        other developers. Personal recommendation: Black Ops 1 is the best Call of Duty ever made.</p>

                                        heists while under pressure from a corrupt government agency and powerful criminals. The open world

                                        <p> Dark Souls is a third-person action role-playing game. A core mechanic of the game is
                                            exploration.
                                            Players are encouraged by the game to proceed with caution, learn from past mistakes, or find
                                            alternative areas to explore. Dark Souls takes place in a large and continuous open world
                                            environment,
                                            connected through a central hub area. The player character can travel between areas and explore
                                            various paths at will, although prerequisites have to be met to unlock certain areas.</p>

                                    <h2>Subnautica</h2>
                                    <p>Subnautica begins with the crash of the Aurora on Planet 4546B, a planet completely covered in water,
                                        in the late 22nd century. There is one sole longterm survivor, who is the protagonist of the story.
                                        It is then up to the player to make it through the initial days with a partially broken Lifepod 5
                                        and
                                        a few resources at their disposal, improve their situation by learning about the alien environment
                                        and gathering resources, building better equipment, and maybe even find a way home. If so chosen,
                                        the player can also start an investigation into what happened to the Aurora and what secrets Planet
                                        4546B holds.</p>

                                    <p>Minecraft is a 3D sandbox game that has no specific goals to accomplish, allowing players a large
                                        amount of freedom in choosing how to play the game. However, there is an achievement system, known
                                        as "advancements" in the Java Edition of the game, and "trophies" on the PlayStation ports. Gameplay
                                        is in the first-person perspective by default, but players have the option for third-person
                                        perspective
                                        . The game world is composed of rough 3D objects‚Äîmainly cubes and fluids, and commonly called
                                        "blocks"‚Äîrepresenting various materials, such as dirt, stone, ores, tree trunks, water, and lava.
                                        The core gameplay revolves around picking up and placing these objects. These blocks are arranged
                                        in a 3D grid, while players can move freely around the world. Players can "mine" blocks and then
                                        place them elsewhere, enabling them to build things. Surely, everyone knows this game.</p>

                                    <p>Forza Horizon focuses specifically on casual street racing, rather than professionally on race tracks
                                        , as it takes place on a map of temporarily closed public roads. It features multiple types of races
                                        , from drift to rally and point-to-point races. The roads feature both AI traffic and when playing
                                        online, other festival drivers. Players may challenge the other racers they encounter in a
                                        one-on-one
                                        race to a given location. The races start at the current location, and finish at a randomly
                                        generated
                                        way-point, usually more than 500 metres away from the player and their opponent. A skill system is
                                        implemented in the game; players earn popularity during races by driving aggressively. Acts such as
                                        drifting, jumping over obstacles and getting a car on two wheels all contribute to the player's
                                        popularity level. These can be chained together in a combo, which in turn affects the money players

                                        a player's popularity level increases new special events are unlocked, such as races against
                                        helicopters and planes.</p>
