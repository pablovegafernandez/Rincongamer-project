                            basically
                            their own genre now. As the name implies, in these games the player will control a character and use a weapon
                            usually a guns or projectile based weapons which can be used in combination with other tools such as grenades
                            for indirect offense, armor for additional defense, or accessories such as telescopic sights to modify the
                            behavior of the weapons. A common resource found in many shooter games is ammunition, armor or health, or
                            upgrades which augment the player character's weapons.</p>

                        Action packed game that thrills any good player. The player is in control and is challenged
                        in things such as hand-eye coordination and quick reflexes. Keep an eye out!

                        <p class="pt-3">In an action game, the player typically controls a character often in the form of a protagonist or
                            avatar. This
                            player character must navigate a level, collecting objects, avoiding obstacles, and battling enemies with their
                            natural skills as well as weapons and other tools at their disposal. At the end of a level or group of levels,
                            the player must often defeat a boss enemy that is more challenging and often a major antagonist in the game's
                            story. Enemy attacks and obstacles deplete the player character's health and lives, and the player receives a
                            game over when they run out of lives.</p>

                        <p>Alternatively, the player gets to the end of the game by finishing a sequence of levels to complete a final
                            goal, and see the credits. But some action games, such as early arcade games, are unbeatable and have an
                            indefinite number of levels; with the player's only goal being to get as far as they can to maximize their
                            score.</p>

                            Strategy video games are a genre of video game that emphasize skillful thinking and planning to achieve victory.
                            Specifically, a player must plan a series of actions against one or more opponents, and the reduction of
                            enemy forces is usually a goal. Victory is achieved through superior planning, and the element of chance takes a
                            smaller role. In most strategy video games, the player is given a godlike view of the game world, and
                            indirectly controls game units under their command. Thus, most strategy games involve elements of warfare to
                            varying degrees, and feature a combination of tactical and strategic considerations. In addition to
                            combat, these games often challenge the player's ability to explore, or manage an economy.

                        <p class="pt-3">Survival games are considered an extension of a common video game theme where the player character
                            is stranded or separated from others and must work alone to survive and complete a goal. Survival games focus on
                            the survival parts of these games, while encouraging exploration of an open world. They are primarily action
                            games, though some gameplay elements present in the action-adventure genre—such as resource management and item
                            crafting—are commonly found in survival games, and are central elements in titles like Survival Kids. At the
                            start of a typical survival game, the player is placed alone in the game's world with few resources. It is not
                            uncommon for players to spend the majority or entirety of the game without encountering a friendly non-player
                            character; since NPCs are typically hostile to the player, the emphasis is placed on avoidance, rather than
                            confrontation. In some games, however, combat is unavoidable and provides the player with valuable resources
                            (e.g., food, weapons, and armor).</p>
